# Sign-up-form

This is a sign up form for TheOdinProject course.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Tailwind

Divided the page in 2 sections using the "flex" layout. The left side is an image background, while the right side contains the signup form.
On the left side I've put an image and above it a transparent "div" with TheOdinProject logo on it. On the right side we have the form,
created using the "grid" layout.

Lessons Learned:

How to use the "grid" and "flex" layouts better.
Form creation and manipulation.
